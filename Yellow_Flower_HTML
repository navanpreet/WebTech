			<h3 id="aboutheading">About</h3>
				<p id="par1">Pig was initially developed at Yahoo! to allow people using Apache Hadoop&#174 to focus more on analyzing large data sets and spend less time having to write <br> mapper and reducer programs. Like actual pigs, who eat almost anything, the Pig programming language is designed to handle any kind of data&#150hence the<br>name!.</p>
				<p id="par2">Pig is made up of two components: the first is the language itself, which is called PigLatin (yes, people naming various Hadoop projects do tend to have a<br>sense of humor associated with their naming conventions), and the second is a runtime environment where PigLatin programs are executed. Think of the<br>relationship between a Java Virtual Maching (JVM) and a Java application. In this section, we'll just refer to the whole entity as Pig.</p>
				<h3 id="moreinformation">More information</h3>
				<p id="par3">Stay on top of all the changes, including Hadoop-based analytics, streaming analytics, warehousing (including BigSQL), data asset discovery, integration<br>and governance. <a id="bottomlink" href="linkpage.html#normallink" target="_blank">This is what a normal links looks like</a>.</p>
